# unit-4-game

This is a crystal collector game that runs on jquery. The game generates a random number between 19 and 120 as the number to match (computerPick). It also generates 4 random number between 1 and 12 and assigns each of the 4 values to a gem button. The user then tries to match the computerPick by clicking on the 4 gem buttons, which will add the randomly generated value to the user's total. If the user's total score matches the computerPick, the game is won. If the user exceeds the computerPick, the game is lost.
